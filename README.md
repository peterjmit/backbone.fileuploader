backbone.fileuploader.js
=========

A backbone view wrapper around html5 file APIs

This is not ever intended to support older browsers or gracefully
degrade/fallback or whatever, there are already plenty of (better) projects
doing all that good stuff i.e. (jQuery File Upload)[http://blueimp.github.com
/jQuery-File-Upload/]
